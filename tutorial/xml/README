You need to check out two directories for this step-by-step tutorial:
    * html/     --> docbook output, useful images
    * images/   --> screenshots

If you need xml source file to build your own html copy, you need:
    * *.xml
    * compile.sh (optional)

build from xml source file (in RHEL 5 Client):

    # sh compile.sh
